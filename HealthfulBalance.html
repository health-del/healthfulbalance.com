            <h3>Physical Health</h3>
                <p>Physical health is a fundamental component of overall well-being. Regular exercise and physical activity can improve cardiovascular health, enhance muscular strength and flexibility, and boost the immune system. Engaging in activities like walking, running, cycling, swimming, or strength training can help maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, and increase longevity.</p>

        <div class="course">
            <h3>Mental Health</h3>
            <p>Physical activity is also linked to mental health benefits. Exercise stimulates the release of endorphins, which are natural mood lifters, helping to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Regular workouts can improve cognitive function, memory, and concentration, as well as promote better sleep patterns.</p>

Consuming a variety of nutrient-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, provides the body with the necessary vitamins, minerals, and energy to function effectively.
